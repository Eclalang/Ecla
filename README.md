## What is Ecla ?

**Ecla** is a programming language that was created to be **simple** and **effortless** to use.  
It is an interpreted language that is written using the **Go** programming language.
Having a simple syntax and numerous standard libraries makes the language easy to learn and use without losing the leverage of advanced features.

## How can you help ?

For now, the project is in its early stages and needs to be popularized.  
We need to be recognized as a programming language by GitHub, therefore we need to have at least **200 repositories** from unique user that uses the Ecla programming language.  
If you do, consider sharing with us your experience with the language and how we can improve it üìà. 

> If you want to help us, you can star the project and share it with your friends ! ‚ù§Ô∏è
